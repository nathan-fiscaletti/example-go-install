# Example Go Install

This package aims to demonstrate how libraries / commands should be organized in a go package.

## Notes

The name of your repository will be the command that users type into the command line. Since my repository is named `example-go-install`, when you install it, that's the command you'll call on the command line.

## Structure

```
mylib
  mylib.go
main.go
```

|||
|---|---|
|`mylib/`|One of many possible libraries that your application has packaged with it.|
|`main.go`|The main entry point for executing the program.|

## `main.go`

The `main.go` file should have it's package set to `package main` and it should have a `main()` function. This is what will be called when your program is executed.

If your `main.go` file needs to make use of any of the libraries in your package, you should import them with the fully qualified URL to the github repository including the sub-directory for the library.

`main.go`
```go
package main

import (
    // Import the library we need
	"github.com/nathan-fiscaletti/example-go-install/mylib"
)

func main() {
	mylib.PrintName("nathan")
}
```

## Installing your package

You should tell users to install your binary using `go install`.

When they run `go install`, it will automatically compile your main package for that platform and place it in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ go install github.com/nathan-fiscaletti/example-go-install@latest
```

Provided the user installing the program has `$GOPATH/bin` in their `$PATH` environment variable, they can now call `example-go-install` from anywhere.

---

Note: if you're testing this out and installing your application multiple times to debug it, make sure you change your `$GOPROXY` environment variable to be `direct`, that will avoid any caching of your projects versions.

```sh
export GOPROXY=direct
```
